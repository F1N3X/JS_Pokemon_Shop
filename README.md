# My PokeShop Project

This project is a simulation of an e-commerce website of pokemons.

For this, I used the Pok√©Api :

<a href="https://pokeapi.co/"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/media/master/logo/pokeapi_256.png"></a>


## It is separated between three pages :

### Home :
- explaining both other pages
- detailing pokemon's prize generation

### Products :
- explore all pokemons and their stats displayed from the API
- add them to your basket

### Basket :
- see all the pokemons you added
- delete those you don't want anymore
- see total cost
- buy them
